This repository contains code which implements several crypto operations:

 * perform EME-OAEP encoding, as specified in PKCS#1 version 2.1, using the Tiger hash
 * perform RSA encryption, decryption, and signing operations using the GMP library [TODO]

To test the oaep code, do this:

 $ gcc -O0 -ggdb -Wall -W -DTEST tiger.o sboxes.o oaep.c -o oaep && ./oaep SomeRandomString

Notes:

To use the OAEP interface, see documentation in oaep.h.
The Tiger code provided herein is largely unmodified from the reference implementation:
